Q1:What is large scale requirements engineering?

At present, the software is more and more important in our life. At the same time, the invisible and abstract nature of software component often redefine engineering approaches to build complex systems. The constant need to consider the new method’s repeatability and production process quality over the software production process for large software systems. In these systems, diversity, complexity and variability may hindered the management of the software development process. Also, with the growing scale and complexity of software systems, they lead to larger and complex requirements. So this is why we need large scale requirement engineering.
Large-scale requirements engineering usually used in a project which have the features as follow:
1.	Market and technology-driven software development
2.	Large, complex software systems
3.	New releases through projects
4.	Several thousands of wishes, needs, and requirements stored in a database
5.	Distributed development
6.	Uncertainty, frequent change and time pressure
7.	Requirements written in plain text
8.	Multiple levels of abstraction


Q2:What are the challenges in large scale requirements engineering?

The complexity and size of software intense systems continues to grow, which in turn gives increasingly large and complex sets of requirements. The amount of embedded software is growing, and the amount of variability is growing even faster. The increased role and importance of software comes with an increased number of requirements. The explosion of new ideas is particularly an inevitable part of a company that operates in MDRE. This flow of new requirements is almost always delivering more requirements for software products than the actual development resources can implement during each project cycle. As a result, the size and complexity of the requirements databases grow even faster than the size and complexity of actual software products.
In LSRE, the size of the requirements databases in this case may exceed tens of thousands of requirements, which puts new expectations on requirements management tool support. Furthermore, as development projects grow in complexity and new products with many features are released to the market, the importance of good practices in requirements management grows. Improving the scalability of requirements engineering and management tools, processes and methods is crucial for succeeding in LSRE contexts. 


Q3:What is the order of magnitude of the number of requirements we are discussing? 

At least More than thousands of requirements.


Summary 1: The Art and Science of Software Release Planning

   This article introduces the release planing analysis of two dimensions. For the subjective, the author thinks the RP in the extend is ill - defined problem, need human intuition and capabilities to clarify the problem before seeking a solution. For the objective, the RP through reasonable modeling and optimization, can save the cost, and can set different plans according to the problems in different sizes. The author hope to combine the two aspects, he put forward a hybrid method based on integer linear programming.
   The author provide 5 different variables: decision variables, resource constraints, feature prioritization, stakeholders, objective functions, and then he make the variables to quantify, and put forward the concrete evaluation algorithm of each variable, through scientific modeling process to calculate the weight of these variables, this model can be more intuitive to every one of the features of value evaluation.


Summary 2: A Case Study Evaluation of the Guideline-Supported QUPER Model for Elicitation of Quality Requirements

   This paper present the complete version and the guidelines of applying of QUPER model. First of all, the author puts forward two main reasons for why need QUPER:
1. A direct need identified in industry
2. A suitable model was not found in the literature
   After that, the author through an example explains the QUPER model for the process of elicitation of QR. The concrete process of the main points and seven steps:
1. Identify candidate QR.
2. Define the scale and the unit.
3. Identify the reference levels.
4. Elicit quality breakpoints.
5. Estimate cost barriers.
6. Set the candidate requirements
7. Identify cost dependencies.
   Later, the author through a practical case to explain in a big company evaluation methodology of QUPER is how to use it. There are two evaluations of the QUPER model carry out to use, they are in-depth semi-structured interviews and self-administrated questionnaires. After that, he mentioned QUPER model more needs to be considered in the use of other factors, such as performance requirements, availability requirements, etc. 
   The author also puts forward a few to use QUPER model concerns. First, there may be difficulties to convince others at the case company to use the model. Second, according to one practitioner, it is important to choose the right QR to apply QUPER.  Third, as several practitioners stated, to fully understand and evaluate the improvements of the decision-making process, the QUPER model should be used in a project from the start of a project until the product is launched to the market.
At the end of the article, the author put forward some further work content, the transferability of guidelines and examples to support methodology adoption, and the use of analogy-based estimations are interesting issues for further research.


Summary 3: Introducing support for release planning of quality requirements –an industrial evaluation of the QUPER model

   The author believes that in the market-oriented product development and release plan, balancing the market competition and the software quality is very important. In order to solve this problem, he put forward an industrial evaluation of the model. The main objective and contribution of the paper is to show how QUPER can be used in one company and in particular the focus is on an evaluation of the industrial introduction of the model.
   The author first introduced the QUPER model development of three main steps, they are problem definition, model definition and model validation. At The same time, he mentioned the QUPER model is based on the observations that quality is continuous and non-linear, and shows the different practice view, cost view and roadmap view of breakpoint.
   After that, the author show a case of Lund university and SONY Ericsson's cooperation project, aims to influence or change some aspects of the research focus.   Through this case, the author found the QUPER model in practical application that QUPER is easy to understand and learn, straight forward, and the not complicated to apply in Sony Ericsson’s current practice. At the same time, there are some challenges: QUPER in terms of network access, it is difficult to identify differentiation and saturation breakpoints. In terms of Email, people may interpret the breakpoints differently. In terms of video system, the time spent may not worth.


Summary 4: A Market-Driven Requirements Engineering Process: Results from an Industrial Process Improvement Programme

   This paper describes a specific industrial RE process for package software which called REPEAT (Requirements Engineering ProcEss At Telelogic), which promising new techniques that can be evaluated in the continuation of the improvement programme.
   First, the author defined the actors in REPEAT which include requirement management group, issuer, customers and users, requirement team, construction team, test team, expert and requirement database.
   At the same time, the author introduced different states of a requirement in the REPEAT process. In elicitation phase, it include collection and classification. In selection phase, its aim to select the requirements which implement in the current release, specify the requirements in more detail and validate the requirements document. In third phase, there include Change Management, Construction, Verification and Conclusion. Meanwhile，the author use a partial process scenario model to explain how REPEAT is enacted in its different phases.
